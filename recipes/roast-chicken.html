    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 whole chicken, 4-5 pounds</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon italian seasoning</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C), place a baking rack in 
            the lower ⅓ of the oven, and bring the chicken to room 
            temperature. Pat the chicken dry with paper towels. </li>
        <li>Place the chicken breast side up in an oven-safe pan. 
            Truss the legs. Drizzle with oil and use your hands to rub 
            it all over the chicken. </li>
        <li>Season the chicken with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning, 
            patting the seasoning in with your hands.</li>
        <li>Roast the chicken for 70 to 90 minutes, or until the juices 
            run clear. Double check doneness with an instant-read thermometer 
            placed in the thickest part of the thigh. It should read 
            165°F (74°C). Let the chicken rest for 15 minutes on a cutting 
            board before slicing and serving. </li>
    </ol>
