    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        There's nothing like classic gravy when you're craving comfort food. This 
        classic chicken gravy comes together in under half an hour with just six 
        ingredients. What more could you ask for? 
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 quart cold chicken stock</li>
        <li>1/3 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>Salt and ground white pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Gradually whisk in 
            flour, reduce heat to low, and stir until the roux has turned golden 
            and smells like a cooked pie crust, 10 to 12 minutes. </li>
        <li> Whisk in about 2 cups of cold stock, a little at a time, 
            stirring to remove any lumps. Add remaining 2 cups stock. </li>
        <li> Cook, stirring occasionally, until gravy is thick enough 
            to coat the back of a spoon, 10 to 15 minutes. </li>
        <li> Stir in heavy cream, and season with salt, white pepper, 
            and cayenne. Taste and if the gravy still tastes starchy, 
            let it simmer a little longer, adding more cold stock if necessary. </li>
        <li> Serve hot and enjoy! </li>
    </ol>
